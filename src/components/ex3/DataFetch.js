	This exercise focuses on Lifecycle Methods -- specifically the two
	 most common, componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate -- as well as
	 JavaScript asynchronousness / Promises.

	‚è∞ Time allocated: 20-25 minutes

	üíö componentDidMount is ran whenever a component is FIRST LOADED. It
		will run ONCE and never again until it is removed (more below the
		code if you want some specifics)
	üíö componentDidUpdate is ran whenever a components' STATE or PROPS are
		updated. This is NOT run on initial render like componentDidMount.
		This lifecycle has TWO PARAMS representing the props and state of
		the component prior to its update.

	Look in the code below for your tasks, marked with ‚ú® -- recommended to read
	 all of them before starting, they are marked loosely with an order to do them in

				You can access the param via `this.props.param`
				üíö requestApi is asynchronous, just like `fetch` for HTTP requests,
					which means you'll need to use `await` to ensure you're getting
					a response before continuing.
					e.g. const resp = await fetch('http://api.google.com', { options })

				handle it however you like (clear state, use an alert, etc) but
				make it obvious to the user something went wrong
			üç∞üç∞ Add and use a "loading" state to show a placeholder value while
			       we are waiting for a response from the server.

		//     state with new data.

	Expanding on above points

	"üíö componentDidMount is ran whenever a component is FIRST LOADED. It
		will run ONCE and never again until it is removed"
	 > Note that we say "loaded" and "mounted", this isn't necessarily an
		ultimate "one-time-only" because if you ever conditionally render the
		component (e.g. with an in-line if-else aka a ternary) then it will rerun
		the componentDidMount every time it's loaded after being previously unloaded
	  For example: if state.A then load <SomeComponent> otherwise load <ThisComponent>
		if A = true, SomeComponents' mount will run, but if you change A to false,
		then back to true again, the mount WILL run again.
