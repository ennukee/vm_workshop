# Vestmark UIS React Training Workshop

This repository holds all of the files necessary to participate in the training workshop. **Please ensure you have cloned this repository and followed the steps below prior to the meeting**.

## Setup

1. Clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/ennukee/vm_workshop.git`
2. `cd vm_workshop` and type `npm install` or `yarn`.
3. This should install all necessary dependencies to run the app
4. When that finished, type `npm run start`
5. Your localhost should boot up, ensure that you can navigate to `localhost:3000` (or whichever port it binds to, should tell you in the console) and see the workshop page.
6. Try each of the links on the sidebar and ensure nothing crashes the app

## Optional steps

1. In VSCode (unsure in what manner this exists in other editors) look for a "React/ES7 snippets" extension. I use `ES7 React/Redux/GraphQL/React-Native snippets` in my VSCode. This allows you to be able to write a small 2-5 letter code and autopopulate tedious boiler plate.
2. For example, I can write `rcc` in a blank file and be able to autogenerate all of the boilerplate needed for a basic **R**eact **C**lass **C**omponent (rcc). Same for functional components (`rfc`) or arrow-function based function components (`rafc`). So on and so forth, it's extremely useful to have for React development if you make your own components.
